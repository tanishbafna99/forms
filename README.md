Google Form Auto-Filler (AI-Powered)

An intelligent automation script that automatically fills Google Forms using your pre-saved profile data.
It uses AI/NLP (Sentence Transformers) to semantically match form labels (like Full Name, Email, Contact, etc.) with your stored personal information — even if the labels are written differently (e.g., Your full name, Contact details, Mail ID).

🚀 Features

✅ Automatically opens any Google Form in Chrome
✅ Detects all input fields (<input>, <textarea>, div[role=textbox])
✅ Uses AI sentence embeddings to match form labels to your profile data
✅ Supports synonyms (e.g., Phone, Contact, Mobile Number)
✅ Works without any API keys
✅ User-friendly CLI prompts
✅ Editable profiles stored in JSON files

🧩 Tech Stack & Libraries
Library	Purpose
Selenium	Automates the browser to open and fill Google Forms
Sentence Transformers	Provides the AI model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic text similarity
Webdriver Manager	Automatically manages and installs ChromeDriver
Difflib (SequenceMatcher)	Provides fuzzy text comparison (backup matching method)
JSON & OS	Used to manage and load saved user profiles
Time, Re	Timing and pattern handling for DOM operations
⚙️ How It Works

Profile Loading

The script looks for a profiles folder.

If it doesn’t exist, it creates one and adds a default file: personal.json.

Example structure:

{
  "Full Name": "Tanish Bafna",
  "Email": "tanishbafna@gmail.com",
  "Phone Number": "9876543210",
  "Address": "Pune, Maharashtra",
  "Occupation": "Computer Engineer",
  "Age": "22"
}


Form Analysis

Opens your Google Form in Chrome.

Finds all text input boxes, textareas, and div-based input fields.

AI Matching

Extracts the label text near each input field.

Compares the label’s meaning to your profile keys using embeddings.

Example:

Label: “Enter your contact number”

Best match: “Phone Number”

Value filled: “9876543210”

Form Filling

Fills detected fields with the matched profile values.

Reports matched and unmatched fields in the terminal.

🧠 AI Model Explanation

Model Used: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
This model comes from the Sentence Transformers
 library.
It converts sentences into embeddings (dense vector representations of meaning).

When the script encounters a field label like "Contact Info", it:

Converts "Contact Info" and "Phone Number" into vectors.

Calculates cosine similarity between the two.

Chooses the profile field with the highest similarity (>0.45 confidence threshold).

This means it recognizes semantic meaning, not just literal words.
